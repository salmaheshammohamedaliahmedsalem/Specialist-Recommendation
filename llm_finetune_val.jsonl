Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that.

My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse. \r\nDoctor: Do you take anything for your allergies? \r\nPatient: Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it. Oh and I was on Advair, too. \r\nDoctor: Did the Flonase or Advair help at all? \r\nPatient: I had to stop Advair because it started to bother my lady parts. \r\nDoctor: How so? \r\nPatient: I noticed that it became more itchy as a result. \r\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that.  \r\nPatient: Speaking of this, I wanted to also share that I've been experiencing a lot of P M S symptoms lately. I'm super impatient and moody.  \r\nDoctor: Do you notice these symptoms are still there after you finish your cycle? \r\nPatient: Um lemme think. The symptoms start about a week before my period and tend to get less intense once I get over the first day of bleeding. \r\nDoctor: Are your cycles generally regular? \r\nPatient: For the most part, yes. I feel like they don't last as long as they used to. I'm not sure why. I do, however, notice some spotting after my cycles end. \r\nDoctor: Do you get any night sweats or hot flashes while you're on your period? \r\nPatient: No.\r\nDoctor: Have you had any other medical troubles recently? \r\nPatient: I did have a U T I and some blood in my urine because of it. \r\nDoctor: Do you remember how many times you noticed blood in your urine? \r\nPatient: Hm about three times. I was prescribed antibiotics for it. \r\nDoctor: Have you had any other urinary symptoms since? How about bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or anything of the like? \r\nPatient: Nothing now.  \r\nDoctor: Have you gotten your urine rechecked recently? \r\nPatient: No, not yet. I really should get it checked out again. \r\nDoctor: I can write an order for you if you'd like or you can make an appointment with your urologist. Do you have a specific urologist that you see? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I can call to make the appointment tomorrow. Do I also need to get blood work done?\r\nDoctor: Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here. \r\nPatient: I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done? \r\nDoctor: Do you know what they checked? \r\nPatient: I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.  \r\nDoctor: Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts? \r\nPatient: I can fax them to you once I get them back. \r\nDoctor: That would be great.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was \"Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.\" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.\nDoctor: How old are you? \r\nPatient: I am seventy three.  \r\nDoctor: Are you right handed or left handed? \r\nPatient: Right. \r\nDoctor: So, I see the chief complaint is memory loss and cognitive decline. Tell me what exactly happened, and how did you notice the symptoms? Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five.\r\nGuest_family: We noticed it the week prior to Thanksgiving last year in nineteen ninety four. We have a family tradition where we play a game and this time, we were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play \"Murder She Wrote\" at one of our family gatherings. She was chosen to be the assassin. \r\nDoctor: Okay. \r\nGuest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \r\nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \r\nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. \r\nDoctor: Was she slurring?\r\nGuest_family: Nope. \r\nDoctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? \r\nGuest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. \r\nDoctor: How was it after returning from there? \r\nGuest_family: She returned to work. She used to work in a local florist shop. She returned on the Monday following Thanksgiving. And she had difficulty.\r\nPatient:  I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register. \r\nGuest_family: She quit the next day, and she never went back. \r\nDoctor: How was it after that? \r\nGuest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. \r\nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \r\nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected.

She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.
