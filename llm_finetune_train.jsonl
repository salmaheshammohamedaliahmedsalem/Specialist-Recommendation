She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.\nDoctor: Good afternoon, sir. \r\nPatient: Good afternoon, doctor.\r\nDoctor: Refresh my memory, please, how old are you, sir?\r\nPatient: I'm forty nine. \r\nDoctor: Also, I need you to remind me, when was your lower back surgery?\r\nPatient: It was in January of two thousand five.

I'm still in a lot of pain. \r\nDoctor: Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?\r\nPatient: I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too. \r\nDoctor: Have you taken any medicines? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.\r\nDoctor: Are you still taking any of these? \r\nPatient: No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything. \r\nDoctor: Have you had any injections for this pain?\r\nPatient: I've had a few into the, um, piriformis. \r\nDoctor: Did that do anything?\r\nPatient: Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six. \r\nDoctor: How did this work? \r\nPatient: Honestly, it did nothing. \r\nDoctor: Where is your pain, exactly?\r\nPatient: I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back. \r\nDoctor: Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that? \r\nPatient: I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back. \r\nDoctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?\r\nPatient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. \r\nDoctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?\r\nPatient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.\r\nDoctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? \r\nPatient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.\r\nDoctor: Does anything make the pain better? \r\nPatient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. \r\nDoctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\r\nPatient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. \r\nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\r\nPatient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. \r\nDoctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?\r\nPatient: Yes, doctor, that's correct.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " General Practitioner"}

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age.  Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.\nDoctor: Good morning, young lady. Is this your mother? \r\nPatient: Yes, this is my mommy. \r\nDoctor: Good morning, mom. Can you tell me more about your daughter, please?\r\nGuest_family: Good morning, doctor. Well, she's thirteen now, but she's had feet problems all her life. \r\nDoctor: What's been the problem with her feet?\r\nGuest_family: Well, she had bilateral feet corrections when she was a year old. \r\nDoctor: Okay, how has she been since that procedure?\r\nGuest_family: Well, just look at her heel, doctor. \r\nDoctor: Yes, I see. She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity. \r\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor? \r\nDoctor: Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?\r\nPatient: Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor. \r\nGuest_family: What can we do about this, doctor? \r\nDoctor: Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. \r\nGuest_family: What does that procedure entail? \r\nDoctor: Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up. \r\nGuest_family: What's the risk of infection with the surgery, sir? \r\nDoctor: Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low.\r\nGuest_family: How is this possible, doctor?\r\nDoctor: We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. \r\nGuest_family: That's great. Will she be asleep for this procedure? \r\nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?\r\nDoctor: Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. \r\nGuest_family: Will she need a brace too?\r\nDoctor: Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?\r\nPatient: Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\r\nDoctor: The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nI had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.\nDoctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? \r\nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \r\nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \r\nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \r\nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \r\nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\r\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \r\nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \r\nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \r\nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \r\nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \r\nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \r\nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \r\nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \r\nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \r\nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \r\nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \r\nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \r\nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \r\nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \r\nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \r\nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \r\nPatient: Sounds good. \r\nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \r\nPatient: That's reassuring. \r\nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \r\nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \r\nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\r\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \r\nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \r\nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \r\nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \r\nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \r\nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I did. \r\nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \r\nPatient: Sounds good. \r\nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \r\nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \r\nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Neurologist"}

The patient was driving a minivan.  The patient states that the car in front of her stopped too quickly and she rear-ended the vehicle ahead of her.  The patient states that she was wearing her seatbelt.  She was driving.  There were no other passengers in the van.  The patient states that she was restrained by the seatbelt and that her airbag deployed.  The patient denies hitting her head.  She states that she does have some mild pain on the left aspect of her neck.  The patient states that she believes she may have passed out shortly after the accident.  The patient states that she also has some pain low in her abdomen that she believes is likely due to the steering wheel or deployment on the airbag.  The patient denies any pain in her knees, ankles, or feet.  She denies any pain in her shoulders, elbows, and wrists.  The patient does state that she is somewhat painful throughout the bones of her pelvis as well.  The patient did not walk after this accident.  She was removed from her car and placed on a backboard and immobilized.  The patient denies any chest pain or difficulty breathing.  She denies any open lacerations or abrasions.  The patient has not had any headache, nausea or vomiting.  She has not felt feverish or chilled.  The patient does states that there is significant deformity to the front of the vehicle that she was driving, which again was a minivan.  There were no oblique vectors or force placed on this accident.  The patient had straight rear-ending of the vehicle in front of her.  The pain in her abdomen is most significant pain currently and she ranks it at 5 out of 10.  The patient states that her last menstrual cycle was at the end of May.  She does not believe that she could be pregnant.  She is taking oral birth control medications and also has an intrauterine device to prevent pregnancy as the patient is on Accutane.\nDoctor: Around what time did the car crash take place? \r\nPatient: About forty five minutes ago. I think someone called nine one one shortly after it happened. \r\nDoctor: Do you happen to remember how fast you were driving at the time of the crash? \r\nPatient: I was driving about forty miles an hour.  \r\nDoctor: What kind of car were you driving? \r\nPatient: A minivan. The car in front of me stopped suddenly and I hit them right from behind. The front of my car is pretty wrecked. \r\nDoctor: Were you wearing a seatbelt? And did the airbag deploy? \r\nPatient: Yes and yes. \r\nDoctor: Any passengers in the car with you? \r\nPatient: No, just me. \r\nDoctor: Did you hit your head anywhere? \r\nPatient: No, but I do have some pain on the left side of my neck. \r\nDoctor: Do you think you lost consciousness at any point in time? \r\nPatient: Actually, I do. Right after the crash. \r\nDoctor: Any pain elsewhere? \r\nPatient: Um I'm having some pain in my lower stomach area. I think it could be due to slamming into the airbag or steering wheel. \r\nDoctor: How would you rate this pain, ten being the worst pain ever? \r\nPatient: Um I'd give it a five out of ten right now. \r\nDoctor: Any knee, ankle, or foot pain? \r\nPatient: No.  \r\nDoctor: How about pain in your shoulders, elbows, or wrists? \r\nPatient: Uh no, but I guess I do have a little bit of pain in my pelvic area. \r\nDoctor: Do you remember walking before or after the ambulance arrived? \r\nPatient: I don't think so.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  There was no open injury.  The patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  There was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle. It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the  procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.\nDoctor: Good evening, and welcome to A B C D General Hospital E D. \r\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor, I've really messed up this ankle. \r\nDoctor: Before we begin, how old are you? And which gender do you identify?\r\nPatient: Thank you for asking, Doctor, I'm a fifty year old man. \r\nDoctor: Thank you, what happened? \r\nPatient: I fell off my liner, and I landed right onto my left foot. \r\nDoctor: How far did you fall? \r\nPatient: Um, it was really about ten feet. \r\nDoctor: Oh, yes, I see. I have some good news for you, there's no gross deformity in this ankle.\r\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly? \r\nDoctor: I don't see any ankle dislocation, which is good. \r\nPatient: Oh, that's good news. \r\nDoctor: Have you had your x rays taken yet?\r\nPatient: Yeah, the tech just brought me back. \r\nDoctor: Great, let me pull them up here. Okay, um, if you look here, you'll see a fracture of your talus. \r\nPatient: Which bone is that?\r\nDoctor: That's your heel, to be specific, it's a grade I V Hawkins fracture of the left talus. You are still neurovascularly intact in the distal region. \r\nPatient: What are we going to do about this? \r\nDoctor: Do you have any other pain from the fall, aside from the ankle?\r\nPatient: No, the ankle really took all of the weight of the fall. \r\nDoctor: Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle. \r\nPatient: Why is that?\r\nDoctor: There is very weak blood flow to the body of this bone, there's a risk for avascular necrosis, which is bone death. \r\nPatient: Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?\r\nDoctor: Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean. \r\nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\r\nDoctor: Yes, you'll be under anesthesia.\r\nPatient: Okay, yes, um, I'd like to go forward with the surgery.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Orthopedic"}

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.\nDoctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\r\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \r\nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\r\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \r\nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \r\nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\r\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \r\nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\r\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \r\nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \r\nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \r\nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \r\nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \r\nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \r\nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \r\nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \r\nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\r\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \r\nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \r\nDoctor_2: That is correct. \r\nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \r\nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \r\nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \r\nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \r\nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \r\nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \r\nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \r\nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \r\nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \r\nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\r\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \r\nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\r\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \r\nPatient: I tried my best to. \r\nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\r\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\r\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \r\nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \r\nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \r\nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \r\nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \r\nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \r\nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \r\nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\r\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \r\nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \r\nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\r\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \r\nDoctor: What was she places on after?\r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \r\nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \r\nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \r\nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \r\nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \r\nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \r\nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \r\nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \r\nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \r\nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \r\nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \r\nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \r\nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \r\nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\r\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \r\nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \r\nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \r\nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \r\nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \r\nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \r\nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \r\nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \r\nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \r\nPatient: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \r\nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \r\nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \r\nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Neurologist"}
{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nErosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.   I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any diarrhea? \r\nPatient: Yes. I have been having diarrhea. When I think about it, it started happening around the same time that the mouth sores started. I didn't have any diarrhea today though. \r\nDoctor: Have you experienced any episodes of nausea or vomiting? \r\nPatient: No. \r\nDoctor: Have you noticed any blood in your bowel movements? \r\nPatient: No. \r\nDoctor: Even though you have been taking the medications without any issue, for about ten years, the methotrexate may be the cause of the mouth sores and the inflammation in the small intestines. These are both common side effects from the use of methotrexate. I am not as familiar with NSAID's causing mouth sores. Aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal upset. I think the most likely cause of the sores is the methotrexate not the use of Aspirin.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Gastroenterologist"}

Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.

He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.

The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.\nDoctor: Good afternoon, who's the victim today, sir? Is it you, or your daughter? \r\nGuest_family: Good afternoon, doctor.

In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?\r\nPatient: Yes, I do. \r\nDoctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?\r\nPatient: No, I didn't, this is new. \r\nDoctor: Is this feeling getting worse? \r\nPatient: Yes, it is. \r\nDoctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. \r\nGuest_family: What should we do?\r\nDoctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 10-year-old right-hand dominant male, who threw himself off a quad on 10/10/2007.  The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.\nDoctor: Remind me, how did he hurt himself?\r\nGuest_family_1: He was riding quads on October tenth two thousand seven when he got thrown off. \r\nDoctor: Yes, and we did O R I F on his fracture dislocation of the left elbow. \r\nGuest_family_1: Yes, he also fractured the neck of his right glenoid, um, if I remember correctly. \r\nDoctor: Which hand does he write with? \r\nGuest_family_1: He writes with his right hand. \r\nDoctor: Okay. That fracture appears to have healed very well; kids generally heal pretty well. How does it feel today? \r\nGuest_family_1: Yes, he's only ten. He's been pretty stiff, so he's been going to P T, and using his Dynasplint.\r\nDoctor: That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. He looks neurologically intact in terms of movement and reflexed in his wrist and hand. \r\nGuest_family_1: Yes, I agree. What is the risk of infection of this surgery? \r\nDoctor: Historically, the risk of infection is less than one percent. \r\nGuest_family_1: Oh, wow, that's low, how is that possible? \r\nDoctor: We'll use prophylactic antibiotics, this controls for infection, and helps keep everything clean.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 13-year-old girl who presented in November with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis.  She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about your daughter's injury? \r\nGuest_family: Well, we came in in November, and she was diagnosed with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis. \r\nDoctor: Did she have surgery on this? \r\nGuest_family: Yes, let me look at my notes, I have it written down here, um, a situ pinning. \r\nDoctor: Remind me, how old are you, dear? \r\nPatient: I'm thirteen now. \r\nDoctor: Okay, thank you. So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. \r\nGuest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this? \r\nDoctor: We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.\r\nGuest_family: Are there any risks of infection from this surgery? \r\nDoctor: Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent. \r\nGuest_family: That's good to hear, will she go to sleep during surgery? \r\nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \r\nGuest_family: What does recovery look like for this surgery? \r\nDoctor: I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything. Other risks include bleeding, but I would not worry about these things. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, how does that sound, honey? Would you like to do this?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\r\nGuest_family: I agree, Doctor, we'll do the surgery.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " General Practitioner"}

He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.

You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. \r\nDoctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. \r\nPatient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. \r\nDoctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? \r\nPatient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 14-year-old girl who started having left knee pain in the fall of 2007.  She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007.  The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only.  The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.  All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.\nDoctor: Good afternoon, dear, how old are you?\r\nPatient: I'm fourteen years old. \r\nDoctor: Good, and what brings you in for a visit today? \r\nPatient: My left knee hurts really bad. \r\nDoctor: Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you? \r\nPatient: Well, since the fall of two thousand seven. \r\nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? \r\nPatient: Mom, can you tell the doctor?\r\nGuest_family: Yes, actually, we went to another orthopedist in November of two thousand seven.\r\nDoctor: I see, and what did this doctor recommend?\r\nGuest_family: We got an MRI, I have a disc with the images, and the report as well right here, if you want to take a look at it. \r\nDoctor: Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia. Has she been to P T?\r\nGuest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. \r\nDoctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? \r\nGuest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it. \r\nDoctor: That's good, and how is your pain today, dear? \r\nPatient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.\r\nGuest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?\r\nDoctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. \r\nGuest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? \r\nDoctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. \r\nGuest_family: What is that?\r\nDoctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?\r\nDoctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.\r\nPatient: Will I be asleep for this?\r\nDoctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. \r\nPatient: Will I need to go back to P T?\r\nDoctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.\nDoctor: So let's start from the beginning.\r\nPatient: Okay.\r\nDoctor: You're seventy nine years old, correct?\r\nPatient: Yes.\r\nDoctor: Right or left handed?\r\nPatient: Right.\r\nDoctor: Do you remember when you had your first fall? \r\nPatient: Hm about a year and a half ago I fell while trying to walk from my bed to the living room.\r\nDoctor: Did you feel lightheaded prior? \r\nPatient: Uh yeah I did have some lightheadedness and I was a bit confused.

The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.\r\nDoctor: Got it.\r\nPatient: To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on.\r\nDoctor: Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?\r\nPatient: Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again. \r\nGuest_family: They admitted him to the hospital and later sent him for rehab.\r\nDoctor: Did rehab help?\r\nPatient: Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.\r\nDoctor: Did you return to your previous health?\r\nPatient: Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight.\r\nDoctor: Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?\r\nPatient: Yeah.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.\nDoctor: Okay I am looking at you for multiple issues today. One of the biggest being swelling on your left leg. Can you tell me more about that?\r\nPatient: Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months. Sometimes it gets better in the morning when I get up, but then throughout the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger, and it feel uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.\r\nDoctor: How old are you, miss?\r\nPatient: I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress. \r\nDoctor: Did you hurt your shoulder?\r\nPatient: No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.  I am losing strength in the left shoulder gradually for the last year.\r\nDoctor: Ok let's look at your labs.\r\nPatient: So far white counts are high. In April two thousand five Doctor X Y Z was asked to look at my high white count, but she thought it wasn't a problem and asked me to come for follow up.\r\nDoctor: Any other complaints?\r\nPatient: I have a lot of frequency with urination, and I get up to pee at night at least two to three times.   Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds.\r\nDoctor: Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed. \r\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it.\r\nDoctor: How about chest pain or shortness of breath?\r\nPatient: No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath.\r\nDoctor: What work you do?\r\nPatient: I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher. My work demands sitting a lot, and just really does not move around much.  But towards the end of the day my leg swells up.\r\nDoctor: Okay that's okay.\r\nPatient: I need cholesterol check right?\r\nDoctor: Yes, you do, but all the other labs are normal.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Cardiologist"}

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain.  He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994.  I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim.  Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.\nDoctor: Good afternoon, sir. \r\nPatient: Good afternoon, doctor. \r\nDoctor: You're forty four, correct? \r\nPatient: Yes sir. \r\nDoctor: Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir? \r\nPatient: Well, doctor, I've had lower back pain for a while now. \r\nDoctor: Does the pain go into your legs? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I have pain in my right thigh too. \r\nDoctor: Is there an injury associated with this pain? \r\nPatient: Yes, I had an incident back in nineteen ninety four. \r\nDoctor: Do you have any paperwork or medical records from the initial injury? \r\nPatient: No sir, I don't have those today. \r\nDoctor: What do you do for a living, sir? \r\nPatient: Right now, I work at Taco Bell.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had \"zig-zag lines\" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.\nDoctor: Nurse, did you get the documents from the patient?\r\nGuest_clinician: I did.

He had right distal medial hamstring release performed in February 2007 and has done quite well and has noted significant improvement in his gait and his ability to play.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.\nDoctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am?\r\nPatient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. \r\nDoctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? \r\nPatient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. \r\nDoctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \r\nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \r\nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \r\nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \r\nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \r\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \r\nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \r\nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \r\nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \r\nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \r\nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \r\nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\r\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \r\nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \r\nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \r\nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \r\nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\r\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \r\nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \r\nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \r\nPatient: No, none. \r\nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \r\nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\r\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \r\nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \r\nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \r\nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \r\nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\r\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \r\nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \r\nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \r\nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \r\nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \r\nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \r\nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \r\nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \r\nPatient: Yes, we think so.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Neurologist"}

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis is a 42-year-old white female who comes in today for a complete physical and follow up on asthma.  She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.\nDoctor: Hello, miss. Before we begin your physical, could you verify your age and ethnicity for me, please? \r\nPatient: I'm forty two years old and identify as white. \r\nDoctor: Thank you.

My allergies are also acting up again. \r\nDoctor: Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse? \r\nPatient: Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse. \r\nDoctor: Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies? \r\nPatient: I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see. \r\nDoctor: Let me take a look. I see you have been taking Allegra for your allergies. Has that been helping? \r\nPatient: Eh. It kind of helps when I do take it. \r\nDoctor: You don't take it every day then? \r\nPatient: Nope. Only when I feel like I need to. \r\nDoctor: I see. What about the Flonase? Has that been helping? \r\nPatient: I'm not taking that right now, but it helped me in the past. \r\nDoctor: I also see you took Advair in the past, correct? Do you still take it? \r\nPatient: I did, but I stopped taking it because it started to annoy my private area. \r\nDoctor: I understand. Speaking more on this. Let's begin your physical. Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more? \r\nPatient: Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period. \r\nDoctor: I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle? \r\nPatient: Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better. \r\nDoctor: When do you see your mood change? \r\nPatient: My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start. \r\nDoctor: Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle? \r\nPatient: Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there. \r\nDoctor: I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats? \r\nPatient: Nope. I feel fine most of the time. \r\nDoctor: That's good.

He states that for the past six months he has experienced cramps in his feet and hands.  He describes that the foot cramps are much more notable than the hand ones.  He reports that he develops muscle contractions of his toes on both feet.  These occur exclusively at night.  They may occur about three times per week.  When he develops these cramps, he stands up to relieve the discomfort.  He notices that the toes are in an extended position.  He steps on the ground and they seem to \"pop into place.\"  He develops calf pain after he experiences the cramp.  Sometimes they awaken him from his sleep. He also has developed cramps in his hands although they are less severe and less frequent than those in his legs.  These do not occur at night and are completely random.  He notices that his thumb assumes a flexed position and sometimes he needs to pry it open to relieve the cramp. He has never had any symptoms like this in the past.  He started taking Bactrim about nine months ago.  He had taken this in the past briefly, but has never taken it as long as he has now.

They're completely random and not in the nighttime. Sometimes my thumb gets so flexed that I have to move it to bring it to the right position and to relieve the cramp. \r\nDoctor: Did you ever have this symptom before? \r\nPatient: No, not like this. \r\nDoctor: Are you taking any medications? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I took an antibacterial called Bactrim around nine months ago.

He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.\nDoctor: Before we begin today, sir, I just need a few pieces of background information. I see here on my chart that you're thirty years old, is that correct? \r\nPatient: Yes doctor, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: Okay, and which hand is your dominant hand? \r\nPatient: I use my right hand for everything. \r\nDoctor: Now, take me through the timeline of your symptoms, please. When did everything start?\r\nPatient: I was doing well until July of nineteen ninety three. \r\nDoctor: What were your initial symptoms? \r\nPatient: I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too. \r\nDoctor: Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?\r\nPatient: At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out. \r\nDoctor: Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated? \r\nPatient: After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck. \r\nDoctor: Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?\r\nPatient: Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two.\r\nDoctor: Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven.  \r\nPatient: That means tumor, right?\r\nDoctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here. \r\nDoctor: Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?\r\nPatient: Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse. \r\nDoctor: Once your symptoms worsened, what happened? \r\nPatient: Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side. \r\nDoctor: Did you have any weakness, sir?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms.\r\nDoctor: Was one side worse than the other? \r\nPatient: Yes, my right side was worse than my left. \r\nDoctor: In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms? \r\nPatient: Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high. \r\nDoctor: After all these symptoms began, how were you treated? \r\nPatient: On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too. \r\nDoctor: Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa.\r\nPatient: Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?\r\nDoctor: Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too. \r\nDoctor: Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma. \r\nPatient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three. \r\nDoctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms? \r\nPatient: I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four. \r\nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since?\r\nPatient: I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food. \r\nDoctor: How much weakness was there?\r\nPatient: It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself. \r\nDoctor: Can you go up and down stairs?\r\nPatient: No, not really, but I can climb them. \r\nDoctor: How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?\r\nPatient: Yeah, no problems there. \r\nDoctor: Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?\r\nPatient: They were considering doing chemo.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Oncologist"}

He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this. He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.\nDoctor: Hello, sir. How are you today? Can you confirm your age?\r\nPatient: Fifty eight.

I felt like I couldn't control my body. My balance got even worse, and I felt even more tired and weak.\r\nDoctor: Oh, wow. Do you know why your balance and coordination worsened? \r\nPatient: I did fall recently, but I know for a fact my balance was off before my fall. \r\nDoctor: How high were you when you fell?\r\nPatient: I think I was three or five feet high when I fell. \r\nDoctor: Did you fall on your back?\r\nPatient: No, I fell on my feet.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.\nDoctor: Good morning, young man.\r\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. \r\nDoctor: Who is this young lady, is this your grandmother, or sister?\r\nGuest_family: Oh doctor, yes, I am his grandmother. \r\nDoctor: Good, my chart says that you're fourteen years old. Is that correct? \r\nPatient: Yes sir. \r\nDoctor: Good, so what seems to be the problem today? \r\nPatient: I've been having pain in this knee for about a month now. \r\nDoctor: Can you remember a specific injury to this knee?\r\nPatient: Um, yeah, I was playing basketball when I jumped, and then when I landed I felt this knee pop. \r\nDoctor: Do you remember the date of your injury, young man?\r\nGuest_family: Um, it was on December twenty second two thousand seven. \r\nDoctor: Good, so how have you been treated for this so far? \r\nPatient: We went to another clinic first, and they put me in a splint. \r\nGuest_family: Yeah, and then they referred us over to Children's. \r\nDoctor: Have they taken x rays yet?\r\nPatient: Yes, I got back a few minutes ago. \r\nDoctor: Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg. \r\nPatient: What, where? Can you show me?\r\nDoctor: Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta. \r\nGuest_family: What does that mean, doctor? \r\nDoctor: Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.\r\nGuest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? \r\nDoctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. \r\nGuest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? \r\nDoctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? \r\nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.\r\nGuest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?\r\nDoctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen. \r\nGuest_family: Yes, his father agrees.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy.  She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.\nDoctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. You're forty one years old, correct? \r\nPatient: Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: Thank you, have you followed up with Doctor X since your surgery? \r\nPatient: Why would I do that? \r\nDoctor: Oh, just because she referred you to me. \r\nPatient: Oh, no, I haven't yet. \r\nDoctor: That's fine.

Also, we're going to move you to S I C U room one. \r\nPatient: Can you tell me the details about what you're going to do? \r\nDoctor: Well, this is a P M T halo, I like this one better than the Bremer halo vest, and I'll use morphine and Versed.\r\nPatient: Are you going to use anesthesia? \r\nDoctor: Yes, I have local anesthetic, it's xylocaine and epinephrine, um, it's somewhere between fifteen and twenty C C.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " General Practitioner"}

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.\nDoctor: When was your injury, sir? \r\nPatient: Um, if I recall, it was on November twentieth two thousand eight. \r\nDoctor: What do you do for a living, sir? \r\nPatient: I work at the Purdy Correctional Facility, doctor. \r\nDoctor: How did you get hurt?\r\nPatient: Well, an inmate broke some of the overhead sprinklers, and I slipped on all the water and I landed on the back of my head, and then onto my back. \r\nDoctor: Which side took most of the hit? \r\nPatient: It was mostly on my left side. \r\nDoctor: How were you after the fall? \r\nPatient: Well, I was pretty stunned, mostly. I didn't want to come in, but my employers asked me to just to be sure. \r\nDoctor: Who has evaluated you to date?\r\nPatient: Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion.\r\nDoctor: What did they do at the hospital? \r\nPatient: Um, they did a C T scan, and they found a dark spot on my brain. \r\nDoctor: What did they recommend about the spot? \r\nPatient: They said I should have another M R I and they diagnosed an, um, recurrent acoustic neuroma. \r\nDoctor: So, you've had this before? How did they know you had it? \r\nPatient: I used to see a chiropractor, and they suggested that I get a scan and that's how they found it before. \r\nDoctor: When was this? \r\nPatient: Um, it was in October of two thousand five. \r\nDoctor: Did you have surgery on this? \r\nPatient: Yes, I'm recovering now. \r\nDoctor: Are they still considering radiation?\r\nPatient: Yes, it's under consideration but there's no final decision yet.\r\nDoctor: Okay, what does the chiropractor do for you?\r\nPatient: You know, the usual, adjustments and massages, stuff like that. \r\nDoctor: Has there been any improvement? \r\nPatient: Overall, my spine pain has improved a lot. \r\nDoctor: That's good. Okay, so after your fall, what other treatments did you have?\r\nPatient: I went to Prompt Care in Bremerton, and saw Doctor X Y Z. She's an osteopathic doctor. \r\nDoctor: How did she treat you? \r\nPatient: She ordered an M R I of my neck, I have the report right here. \r\nDoctor: Okay, this shows some mild disc bulge at C four C five. Did she let you go back to work?\r\nPatient: Yes, she released me back to full duty. I was doing fine after the neurosurgical treatment. \r\nDoctor: Do you have any other treatment planned?\r\nPatient: Some radiation. \r\nDoctor: What else has she treated you for?\r\nPatient: Oh, you know, just general aches and pains on my back and neck.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nMs. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it \"every other night.\"  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times \"snoring\" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).\nDoctor: Welcome to the clinic, Miss A. \r\nPatient: Thank you. \r\nDoctor: Let's start with your medical history. What medical conditions do you have? \r\nPatient: Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. \r\nDoctor: What kind of cancer do you have? \r\nPatient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. \r\nDoctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? \r\nPatient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. \r\nDoctor: Have you had any other surgeries? \r\nPatient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  \r\nDoctor: How are you feeling today? \r\nPatient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. \r\nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? \r\nPatient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \r\nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \r\nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \r\nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \r\nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \r\nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \r\nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \r\nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \r\nPatient: Okay.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 52-year-old male who is here for independent medical evaluation.  The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.\nDoctor: Good afternoon, sir. Welcome in. Let's get started, how old are you?\r\nPatient: Good afternoon, doctor.

When did you get hurt? \r\nPatient: It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October. \r\nDoctor: Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time. \r\nDoctor: What happened when you got hurt this time? \r\nPatient: I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain. \r\nDoctor: What kind of pain did you feel? \r\nPatient: I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes. \r\nDoctor: Does your pain go down your legs?\r\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee. \r\nDoctor: How have your symptoms progressed since they began?\r\nPatient: Doctor, they've only gotten worse. \r\nDoctor: Do you have any pain in your left leg?\r\nPatient: A little, not as bad as the right. \r\nDoctor: What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg? \r\nPatient: The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more. \r\nDoctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? \r\nPatient: Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first. \r\nDoctor: What did they do for you?\r\nPatient: He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches. \r\nDoctor: Did this help at all?\r\nPatient: No, not at all. \r\nDoctor: Who else have you seen?\r\nPatient: I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp. \r\nDoctor: When did you see them? \r\nPatient: That was back in April. \r\nDoctor: What did they recommend? \r\nPatient: Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here. \r\nDoctor: Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good.

What is your work status right now? \r\nPatient: Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor. \r\nDoctor: I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement. \r\nPatient: He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him. \r\nDoctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? \r\nPatient: Yes, I did. \r\nDoctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? \r\nPatient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. \r\nDoctor: Did you have this done? \r\nPatient: Yes, I did. \r\nDoctor: Did this help at all? \r\nPatient: No, it did absolutely nothing. \r\nDoctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have? \r\nPatient: I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D. \r\nDoctor: Do you have the results of that as well? \r\nPatient: Yes, doctor, they're right here. \r\nDoctor: Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news. What aggravates your pain?\r\nPatient: Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs. \r\nDoctor: When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?\r\nPatient: It's really on my right. \r\nDoctor: Are you able to sleep at night?\r\nPatient: No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all. \r\nDoctor: Have you been able to return to work?\r\nPatient: Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about.\r\nDoctor: Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times. \r\nDoctor: Did they do anything to help you feel better?\r\nPatient: Really, no, it did not.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.\nDoctor: How are you doing today, sir? \r\nPatient: Honestly, I'm pretty sick today. I've got a lot going on. \r\nDoctor: How long have you been feeling this way?\r\nPatient: Well, it's been off and on for about a month now. \r\nDoctor: Has it been getting worse recently? \r\nPatient: Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks. \r\nDoctor: What are your symptoms? \r\nPatient: Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm.

I need a refill. \r\nDoctor: What other problems are you having? \r\nPatient: My foot keeps breaking out. \r\nDoctor: Has this improved at all? \r\nPatient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. \r\nDoctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? \r\nPatient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. \r\nDoctor: How was this treated?\r\nPatient: They gave me Nizoral cream.\r\nDoctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.\r\nPatient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  \r\nDoctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? \r\nPatient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? \r\nDoctor: Have you ever done that before? \r\nPatient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. \r\nDoctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. \r\nPatient: Cool, can we do blood work, too? I want to check on my prostate. \r\nDoctor: Well, that's called P S A. \r\nPatient: Can I have that done? I'm concerned. I am fifty after all. \r\nDoctor: Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high. \r\nPatient: You know, I've been working on that.

On good days, he's very nice to talk to. \r\nDoctor: What is his living status?\r\nGuest_family: He lives at a board and care. It is a cozier homelike place.  \r\nDoctor: That's good. So what brings you here in the emergency today?\r\nGuest_family: He started complaining of stomach aches. Luckily, I was there. It was very sudden at one moment he was talking to me nicely and then all of a sudden he started complaining of severe pain in his stomach area.

I am reading the C T Scan report provided by the patient. It states that patient has dilated bladder with thick wall suggesting an outlet obstruction as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter.\r\nPatient: Hm. \r\nDoctor: I see that you have already been given some I V fluid along with antibiotics by the emergency room doctor. \r\nGuest_family: Yeah. \r\nDoctor: Did he ever complain of pain during urination or nausea and vomiting?\r\nGuest_family: Yes, he had fever a few days back. When we asked him about other symptoms, he said, it's hard to urinate and it is painful. Nausea and vomiting are something that I am not sure about. He was normally rushing to the restroom and every time used to say he didn't want to pee as it hurt him. He also had a few accidents in the last few days where he wet himself. \r\nDoctor: Thank you for providing me with all his history. It will be very helpful for me to treat him now.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " General Practitioner"}

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.\nDoctor: Hi, how are you doing?\r\nPatient: I'm good. Thank you.\r\nDoctor: How old are you, young lady? \r\nPatient: Eighty four.\r\nDoctor: What brings you here?\r\nPatient: I had a fall. And I was told to consult you for my heart conditions.\r\nDoctor: Okay. Um? Can you tell me a little detail about anything you experienced before or diagnosed before?\r\nPatient: Yeah, I have high blood pressure. And they also diagnosed me with other heart diseases. I cannot pronounce all the names I don't remember.\r\nDoctor: That's fine. Let me go through your medical record first. \r\nDoctor: Let's see what we have here. Looks like you have your plate full. Your record says you had hypertension I mean, high blood pressure. Also, you have a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation. \r\nPatient: Wow! Those are a lot of fancy words that I can never remember. \r\nDoctor: Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list. \r\nPatient: What does it mean?\r\nDoctor: It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?\r\nPatient: Hm, okay.\r\nDoctor: So tell me what happened? How did you fall?\r\nPatient: I'm not sure about how it happened, but yeah, I fell yesterday on my driveway and kind of hit a rock.\r\nDoctor: Which side did you hit the rock?\r\nPatient: Um I think it was left side.\r\nDoctor: What happened in the emergency room?\r\nPatient: They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high. \r\nDoctor: Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties.\r\nDoctor: Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. \r\nPatient: They also did the same test this morning. \r\nDoctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one. \r\nDoctor: How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?\r\nPatient: I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life. \r\nDoctor: Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?\r\nPatient: No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident. \r\nDoctor: That is good. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your chest?\r\nPatient: I don't think so.\r\nDoctor: How about before the fall? Did you have any pain or discomfort in your chest before the fall?\r\nPatient: Nope.\r\nDoctor: how about shortness of breath?\r\nPatient: No, not even before the fall. I'm able to walk and I'm sure I can climb stairs. Maybe two floors without any problems.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Cardiologist"}

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nMs. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic.  On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.\nDoctor: Good morning, Miss X Y Z, correct? \r\nPatient: Yes, that's me, good morning doctor. \r\nDoctor: Before we begin, I just need a few pieces of information.

What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? \r\nPatient: I've done a full course of PT for this. \r\nDoctor: Where is your knee pain? \r\nPatient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.\r\nDoctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? \r\nPatient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? \r\nDoctor: Yes, that's the femur. \r\nPatient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. \r\nDoctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?\r\nPatient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. \r\nDoctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?\r\nPatient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.\r\nDoctor: Are you having any back pain? \r\nPatient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.\r\nDoctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. \r\nDoctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?\r\nPatient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.\r\nDoctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?\r\nPatient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.\r\nDoctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?\r\nPatient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. \r\nDoctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\r\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \r\nDoctor: Is there any instability? \r\nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \r\nDoctor: Are you working right now?\r\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \r\nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \r\nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \r\nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\r\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \r\nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \r\nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \r\nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \r\nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \r\nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\r\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \r\nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \r\nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \r\nDoctor: What about at its worst?\r\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \r\nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\r\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here. \r\nDoctor: Thanks. I see.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.\nDoctor: Hello, sir how can I help you? Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\r\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \r\nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\r\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \r\nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\r\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \r\nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \r\nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \r\nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\r\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \r\nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever.

He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement.  He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further.  He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities.

{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 58-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right arm pain.  He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm.  It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time.  He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.\nDoctor: Welcome back. \r\nPatient: Thank you. \r\nDoctor: You are back for a follow up on your right arm pain, right? \r\nPatient: Yes. It has been almost a year since the pain first started. \r\nDoctor: How has your arm been feeling? \r\nPatient: I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm. \r\nDoctor: How long does the pain last? \r\nPatient: It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day. \r\nDoctor: Remind me again. You are right handed. Right? \r\nPatient: Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain. \r\nDoctor: I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand? \r\nPatient: No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers. \r\nDoctor: Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries? \r\nPatient: It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years. \r\nDoctor: Did you see anyone for the neck pain? \r\nPatient: Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \r\nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \r\nPatient: Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven. \r\nDoctor: How old are you?\r\nPatient: I am fifty eight. \r\nDoctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections? \r\nPatient: Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble. \r\nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for the pain? \r\nPatient: There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse. \r\nDoctor: Okay. \r\nPatient: I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it. \r\nDoctor: Okay. Does the pain prevent you from doing your daily activities or decrease your quality of life? \r\nPatient: No. I can do everything like normal, but constant nagging pain does get to me at times.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Neurologist"}
{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThe patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year.  The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally.  He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk.  Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about your son, please? \r\nGuest_family: Sure, he's ten years old now. \r\nDoctor: How long has he used his walker?\r\nGuest_family: Well, he's been using that since he started walking. \r\nDoctor: How old was he when he started walking?\r\nGuest_family: He was about a year old. \r\nDoctor: Good, what seems to be the problem today?\r\nGuest_family: He keeps complaining about the back of his legs being tight.\r\nDoctor: Can you sit on the table, young man? Yes, I'm bending his legs, we call this the popliteal angle, and both sides flex to only about twenty. \r\nGuest_family: Where should that be normally?\r\nDoctor: He should be able to get to ninety. \r\nGuest_family: What can we do about this? \r\nDoctor: I think we should do surgery on this leg. How does he walk? Can I see?  \r\nGuest_family: Well, just look at him. \r\nDoctor: Yes, he does not walk with a crouched pattern, but he is toe walking. \r\nGuest_family: Can we correct that instead of the hamstring tightness? \r\nDoctor: Well, I believe he should have surgery on the hamstring, as well. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, right now we want to do surgery to fix his walking. What are the risks of infection?\r\nDoctor: They're low, historically, they're less than one percent. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this? Is this worth it?\r\nDoctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. It is worth it because the chances of the risks happening are low. \r\nGuest_family: Yes, we'd like to do the procedure. Let me text my husband really quick. Okay, yes, my husband agrees.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " General Practitioner"}

What are the risks of infection of the procedure? \r\nDoctor: It's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation of the limb, changes in motion, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, the possible need for another procedure, and possible early arthritis. I would not worry, though. These things are rare.\r\nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep the entire time?\r\nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, my husband agrees. We want to do the surgery.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Orthopedic"}
{"prompt": "### Patient Background:\nThis is a 78-year-old male who recently had his right knee replaced and also back surgery about a year and a half ago.  He has done well with that.  He does most of the things that he wants to do.  He travels at every chance he has, and he just got back from a cruise.  He denies any type of chest pain, heaviness, tightness, pressure, shortness of breath with stairs only, cough or palpitations.  He sees Dr. Ferguson.  He is known to have Crohn's and he takes care of that for him.  He sees Dr. Roszhart for his prostate check.  He is a nonsmoker and denies swelling in his ankles.\nDoctor: Hello, sir. Looks like we are here for a general wellness check?\r\nPatient: Yes, sir. In my seventy eight years on this Earth, I have learned to take my health more seriously. I need to start catching things before they come, not after. \r\nDoctor: I could not agree more. From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?\r\nPatient: Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery. \r\nDoctor: What do you do with your new body?\r\nPatient: I travel every chance I get. I just got back from a cruise. \r\nDoctor: I hope to be as agile as you when I get to retirement. Now let's check the other systems. Do you feel any type of chest pain? Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?\r\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\r\nDoctor: How about shortness of breath?\r\nPatient: I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs. \r\nDoctor: That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too. \r\nPatient: I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs. \r\nDoctor: Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?\r\nPatient: No. \r\nDoctor: Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?\r\nPatient: Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that. \r\nDoctor: Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?\r\nPatient: Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart. \r\nDoctor: You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?\r\nPatient: Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling. After quitting smoking ten years ago I had to get addicted to something else and that was walking and travelling.\n\n### Assistant Instructions:\nGenerate adaptive medical pre-consultation questions:", "completion": " Cardiologist"}
